# 🔧 ML Engineering

Training a model is 10% of the work. The other 90% is getting it into production—handling data, deploying reliably, monitoring performance, and keeping everything running. ML engineering bridges the gap between "it works on my laptop" and "it works for millions of users."

## 📊 Data Engineering

Models are only as good as their data. Learn to query, clean, and prepare data at scale.
