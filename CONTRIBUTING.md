# Contributing to the ML Road Map

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This roadmap aims to be a high-quality, streamlined path for learning ML and AI. We welcome contributions that genuinely improve the learning experience.

## What We're Looking For

**Ideal contributions:**
- Hands-on tutorials and projects, or in-depth explanations
- Free resources that fill gaps in the current roadmap or improve it
- Paid resources that streamline learning as an alternate option (see below)
- Resources from reputable sources (established educators, companies, universities)
- Content that's been tested and proven effective for learners

**We're NOT looking for:**
- Low-effort content or link dumps
- Promotional material disguised as educational content
- Resources that duplicate what's already well-covered
- AI-generated content farms

## How to Contribute

1. **Check the existing roadmap** — Make sure your resource fills a genuine gap or improves what's there
2. **Open a PR** — Add the resource to the appropriate section in README.md. I'll review all submissions personally.

## Contribution Guidelines

- One resource per PR (keeps reviews manageable)
- Follow the existing format: `- [Resource Name](URL) by Author — Brief description`
- Place the resource in the correct section
- Keep descriptions concise and factual (no marketing language)
- Test your links before submitting

## Adding Your Own Content

Created something that would help learners? We love original content from the community.

**Requirements for self-submissions:**
- Must be high-quality (hands-on or in-depth)
- Must fill a gap or improve the existing roadmap
- You should be genuinely knowledgeable in the topic

If you contribute your own original *free* learning resource and you're in the US, reach out to me on [X (@loganthorneloe)](https://x.com/loganthorneloe) — I'd love to send you some AI for Software Engineers swag as a thank you!

## Paid Resource Submissions

Paid resources are welcome if they genuinely streamline the learning path. These require additional review to ensure they meet our quality bar and provide real value. Swag is reserved for free resource contributions, but we appreciate paid submissions that help learners!
