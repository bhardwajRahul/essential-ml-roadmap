# Contributing to the ML Road Map

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This roadmap aims to be a high-quality, streamlined path for learning ML and AI. We welcome contributions that genuinely improve the learning experience.

## What We're Looking For

**Ideal contributions:**
- Hands-on tutorials and projects (not just explanations)
- Free resources that fill gaps in the current roadmap
- Resources from reputable sources (established educators, companies, universities)
- Content that's been tested and proven effective for learners

**We're NOT looking for:**
- Paid courses or resources behind paywalls (exceptions made for exceptional quality)
- Low-effort content or link dumps
- Promotional material disguised as educational content
- Resources that duplicate what's already covered
- AI-generated content farms

## How to Contribute

1. **Check the existing roadmap** — Make sure your resource fills a genuine gap
2. **Open an issue first** — Describe the resource and why it belongs in the roadmap
3. **Submit a PR** — If approved, add the resource to the appropriate section in README.md

## Contribution Guidelines

- One resource per PR (keeps reviews manageable)
- Follow the existing format: `- [Resource Name](URL) by Author — Brief description`
- Place the resource in the correct section
- Keep descriptions concise and factual (no marketing language)
- Test your links before submitting

## Adding Your Own Content

Created something that would help learners? We love original content from the community.

**Requirements for self-submissions:**
- Must be high-quality and hands-on
- Must be free to access
- Must fill a gap not covered by existing resources
- You should be genuinely knowledgeable in the topic
