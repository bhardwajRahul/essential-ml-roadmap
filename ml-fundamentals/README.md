# 🧠 ML Fundamentals

This is where you learn how machine learning actually works. Not specific techniques or frameworks—the core concepts that everything else builds on.

You'll understand what it means for a model to "learn," how to tell if it's learning well, and why certain approaches work. Master this, and advanced topics become straightforward extensions rather than mysterious black boxes.
