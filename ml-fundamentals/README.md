# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Everything you need to understand machine learning—from core concepts to advanced techniques to real-world applications. This is where you learn how ML actually works, not how to deploy it (that's ML Engineering) or how to build products with existing models (that's AI Engineering).

## Getting Started

Start here. These resources teach you what it means for a model to "learn," how to evaluate performance, and why certain approaches work.
