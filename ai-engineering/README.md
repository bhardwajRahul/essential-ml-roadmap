# 🤖 AI Engineering

AI engineering is about building products with AI—not training models from scratch, but using existing models effectively. You'll learn to write prompts that work reliably, build agents that reason and act, connect AI to your data with RAG, and measure whether your system actually works with evals and benchmarks.

This is the fastest path from "I know Python" to "I ship AI products."

## ✍️ Prompt Engineering

The difference between a useful AI and a frustrating one is often just the prompt. Learn to write prompts that get consistent, high-quality outputs.

## 🤖 AI Agents

Systems that can reason, plan, and take actions—not just generate text.

## 📊 Evals & Benchmarks

You can't improve what you can't measure. Evals tell you if your AI system actually works.

## 🔍 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Connect AI to your data—documents, databases, knowledge bases.
