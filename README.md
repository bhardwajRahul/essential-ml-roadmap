Welcome to the **Machine Learning Road Map**: Your guide to learning ML fundamentals for free!

This guide will equip you with:

- **Essential ML foundations** - Master the mathematical and programming fundamentals that underpin ML.
- **Core ML concepts** - Understand the key principles and algorithms that drive machine learning.
- **Implementation fundamentals** - Gain the conceptual knowledge needed to start building ML systems.
- **Career preparation** - Know the skills that employers value in ML professionals.

This road map is streamlined and focuses on the most important topics from the best ML educators. The goal is simple: *to get you to a point where you can confidently explore ML topics independently**.

**Before you begin:**

> **Don't forget to subscribe to [AI for Software Engineers](https://aiforswes.com/): The AI newsletter for software engineers.**

> **Please support the authors and creators of these resources!** Many of these resources had hundreds of hours put into them. If you purchase a book linked in the advanced topics section, don't forget to leave a review after reading it! Reviews are vital for authors to continue their work. I've linked to social profiles throughout the document as much as I could. You can support the creators of these resources for free by giving them a follow and liking their content.
