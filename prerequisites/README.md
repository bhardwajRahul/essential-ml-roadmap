# 📚 Prerequisites

Machine learning builds on programming and math. Without these foundations, you'll constantly hit walls—tutorials won't make sense, code will break in confusing ways, and you'll waste time debugging basics instead of learning ML.

This section gets you ready. You'll learn Python (the language of ML), the math that makes algorithms work, and the tools every developer needs.

## 🐍 Programming
