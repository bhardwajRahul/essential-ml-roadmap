# ⚡ Advanced Topics

Once you understand ML fundamentals, these are the specialized techniques that power modern AI. Deep learning drives everything from image recognition to language models. Reinforcement learning teaches agents to make decisions. Knowledge distillation shrinks massive models into deployable ones.

Pick based on what you want to build. You don't need all of these—just the ones relevant to your goals.
